We have bodies, and our bodies carry meaning that language cannot fully encode.\n\nPostTalk asks: what if a musician could shape sound with their hands — not by pressing buttons or turning knobs, but through gesture? The performer's hand postures, detected in real time via MediaPipe, control audio effect parameters. The interface disappears. The musician's physical presence becomes the control surface.",

I am drawn to it not just as a technical discipline, but because I see opportunities to apply DSP thinking to acoustic monitoring, soundscape analysis, ecological sensing and human-computer interaction.\n\nThe immediate context was the Audio Programming class at MAT. The brief: build an audio plugin. Rather than building a standard interface, I saw an opportunity to bring my frontend web development skills into the DSP world. Most audio plugins are built entirely in C++ with native GUIs. Mine separates concerns: DSP runs in C++/JUCE on one thread, the UI runs as a Svelte web application delivered via Webview on another.",

Funga Morpho uses generative computer graphics to simulate fungal growth and morphogenesis — the mathematical processes by which biological forms emerge from simple rules. The visuals are not illustrations of fungi; they are processes that are inspired by mycelium. The First Singing is a sound piece built around those bird recordings from Villarrica — Chucao, Queltehue, Fiofío, Rayadito, Bandurria, Martín Pescador — processed and composed in Ableton, drawing on psychoacoustics: the study of how sound shapes our senses.\n\nThe two pieces are connected, so the behavior of the visuals and the sound influence each other in real time.",

The science can describe how certain frequencies and textures tend to affect arousal and valence — the Circumplex Model was a useful reference for thinking about those two axes — but it cannot prescribe which audio effect produces which emotion. At some point the framework runs out and the artistic decision takes over. The model is just a map.",

        narrative: "In 2021 I co-founded Realiza, a sustainability consultancy in Chile. The methodology at its core was one I had been developing since my time at the UC Sustainability Directorate — a repeatable process for helping organizations understand where they stand environmentally and build credible, actionable roadmaps toward carbon neutrality and sustainability certifications.\n\nThe problem this work addresses is deceptively hard: large institutions have fragmented data. Energy consumption lives in facilities. Waste data lives in operations. Commuting data does not exist until you build a survey. Biodiversity data has never been collected at all. The first challenge is always creating data pipelines thinking about the institutional context.",
        technicalDetail: [
            "Data collection: custom survey instruments for commuting, waste, and energy. Qualitative workshops using participatory methodologies (Art of Hosting, Theory U) to surface institutional priorities and identify data owners.",
            "Frameworks applied: GHG Protocol (Scopes 1, 2, 3), SBTi targets, GreenMetric. SDG alignment analysis using Python and SQL when needed.",
            "Data processing and visualization: Python, SQL or other tools for dataset construction, cleaning, and cross-institutional comparison. Custom dashboards in Google Looker designed to communicate to non-technical institutional leadership.",
            "Decision modeling: Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for project prioritization under multiple criteria. Monte Carlo simulation for emissions forecasting under uncertainty, producing future projection models with uncertainty ranges.",
            "Scale: 50+ projects executed through Realiza. Clients include Universidad de Aysén, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, and AJE Group's Bio Amayu agricultural supply chain (SBTi goals).",
        ],
        learnings: [
            "The hardest part of sustainability data work is not the analysis — it is connecting climate goals to the core business and governance. Who owns the data? Who has to change their behavior to collect it? These are political and relational questions as much as technical ones.",
            "Visualizing for institutional decision-makers requires stripping out almost everything. A chart that works for a researcher does not work for a university president",
            "Building a consultancy around a methodology forces you to make the implicit explicit — every assumption you hold as an expert has to become a documented step that someone else can follow. Creating a system that can be replicated was the hardest part.",
            "At the beginning, the core motivation was to contribute to climate action. Over time, I learned that when working with companies, impact alone is not enough—the work must also align with business profitability. This shifted my perspective toward identifying where sustainability efforts can generate tangible value for organizations, while still producing meaningful environmental impact.",

        narrative: "After co-founding Realiza and seeing the inefficiencies in the accounting process — chasing departments for spreadsheets, cleaning inconsistent formats, aggregating by hand, then spending weeks on verification before a report could be issued — I knew exactly what was broken. VestaESG is what I would have wanted on day one.\n\nBuilt within Realiza, it is a SaaS platform designed for Chilean higher education institutions to measure, report, and manage their environmental impact — aligned with GHG Protocol, Huella Chile, and the sustainability certification requirements of the Chilean higher education system. Because I had spent years inside the problem, I was positioned to define both the product and the data model, not just manage the build. I coordinated the commercial manager and backend developers, and built the frontend myself.",
        technicalDetail: [
            "Frontend: React 18 + Tailwind CSS + Chart.js + Zustand. Dashboard-first design — each department sees its own energy, water, and waste data; administrators see aggregated institutional totals and trend lines across campuses.",
            "Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.12) with a three-layer middleware stack for authentication and others. I wasn't in charge of this layer, but I had to learn and understand it deeply to design the frontend and coordinate the team effectively.",

        learnings: [
            "Building a product to solve your own problem is an advantage, but also a trap: you design for yourself and forget that users do not share your mental model of the data. The hardest UX decisions came from unlearning assumptions I had as a carbon accounting expert.",
            "Knowing the domain deeply meant I could skip the discovery phase that most product teams spend months on — I could go straight to designing around constraints like Scope 3 data fragmentation and Huella Chile verification requirements.",
            "Frontend development for data-heavy applications is a UX problem as much as a coding problem. Showing many indicators without overwhelming the user requires real design judgment, not just component architecture.",
