We have bodies, and our bodies carry meaning that language cannot fully encode.\n\nPostTalk asks: what if a musician could shape sound with their hands — not by pressing buttons or turning knobs, but through gesture? The performer's hand postures, detected in real time via MediaPipe, control audio effect parameters. The interface disappears. The musician's physical presence becomes the control surface.",

The brief: build an audio plugin. Rather than building a standard interface, I saw an opportunity to bring my frontend web development skills into the DSP world.

The birds I heard there — their calls layered into the texture of the landscape — became the raw material for the project.\n\nThe project has two interconnected pieces. Funga Morpho uses generative computer graphics to simulate fungal growth and morphogenesis — the mathematical processes by which biological forms emerge from simple rules. The visuals are not illustrations of fungi; they are processes that are inspired by mycelium. The First Singing is a sound piece built around those bird recordings from Villarrica — Chucao, Queltehue, Fiofío, Rayadito, Bandurria, Martín Pescador — processed and composed in Ableton, drawing on psychoacoustics: the study of how sound shapes our senses.\n\nThe two pieces are connected, so the behavior of the visuals and the sound influence each other in real time.",

The science can describe how certain frequencies and textures tend to affect arousal and valence — the Circumplex Model was a useful reference for thinking about those two axes — but it cannot prescribe which audio effect produces which emotion.

The birds.ts model was trained on bird recordings: organic, textured sound collapsed into a 16-dimensional space. NeoChucao asks a simple question: what happens if a performer navigates that space directly, note by note, from a keyboard?\n\nEach MIDI note-on maps to a coordinate in that latent space and feeds the RAVE decoder in real time via SuperCollider's nn.ar. Pitch maps to z0 — the highest-variance axis — velocity to z1, the mod wheel to z2 for timbre morphing, and a CC knob injects Gaussian randomness into z3–z15, giving the performer control over how deterministic or chaotic the instrument sounds. The hardest part was not the code but the mapping: a keyboard implies pitch steps, but latent space has no natural pitch axis — only variance.",

            "The birds.ts TorchScript model (WassersteinRAVE, 16 latent dims, block size 2048 samples) is loaded into scsynth via the nn.ar SuperCollider extension. Each MIDI note spawns a new Synth node running NN(\\birds, \\decode).ar at audio rate. A Lag.kr of 0.05 s on each latent parameter smooths coordinate transitions and prevents clicks between notes.",
            "The RAVE decoder's convolutional layers initialize from zero on every new Synth node, producing near-silence for 200–500 ms while the network fills up. An 800 ms ADSR attack envelope is used to hide this warm-up artefact — a constraint imposed by the model's architecture, not a musical choice.",

Python with Supriya worked technically but shifted development time toward OSC routing and async scheduling — away from musical decisions. Moving everything into a single SuperCollider file made calibration fast enough to happen in real time, which changed what the project could become.",
            "The warm-up artefact — 200–500 ms of near-silence when the decoder's convolutional state initializes from zero — is architectural and unfixable by signal processing alone. Designing the instrument's ADSR around it was the right approach. Distinguishing between a musical decision and a model constraint turned out to matter more than any specific technical fix.",
            "Using a latent space as an instrument is genuinely unpredictable. Some coordinates produce sounds that are striking and alive; others produce noise with no musical value. That instability is not a bug to fix — it is a property of what RAVE learned. The model was trained on birds, which are not musical in any conventional sense. Navigating that space with a keyboard takes time: time to map which regions are expressive, which are dead, and which are worth returning to. Audio encoders trained on non-musical material demand a different kind of performer patience.",

What makes this version compelling is that it makes the geometry of the performance visible. Navigating a 16-dimensional learned space is abstract by nature; the visualization turns it into something you can watch and reason about.

        narrative: "Climate change discourse is dominated by what we must stop: stop pollution, stop fossil fuels, stop emissions. That framing is true but incomplete — and in practice, it paralyzes more than it mobilizes. Real systems have inertia. They do not stop overnight.\n\nAfter years working in sustainability and sharing space with activists, politicians, and conservationists, I became convinced that lasting change comes from making good practices so compelling and effective that bad ones become obsolete — not from shaming people into stopping.\n\nA Fish Story uses a first-person scrolltelling narrative to visualize the positive impact of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) during extreme weather events. Climate change is already here. But we already have tools to adapt — MPAs give marine ecosystems significantly more resilience when heatwaves hit. The story makes that argument visually and emotionally, not just statistically.",

        narrative: "In 2021 I co-founded Realiza, a sustainability consultancy in Chile. The methodology at its core was one I had been developing since my time at the UC Sustainability Directorate — a repeatable process for helping organizations understand where they stand environmentally and build credible, actionable roadmaps toward carbon neutrality and sustainability certifications.\n\nThe problem this work addresses is deceptively hard: large institutions have fragmented data. Energy consumption lives in facilities. Waste data lives in operations. Commuting data does not exist until you build a survey. Biodiversity data has never been collected at all. The first challenge is always creating data pipelines thinking about the institutional context.",

            "Building a consultancy around a methodology forces you to make the implicit explicit — every assumption you hold as an expert has to become a documented step that someone else can follow. Creating a system that can be replicated was the hardest part.",
            "At the beginning, the core motivation was to contribute to climate action. Over time, I learned that when working with companies, impact alone is not enough — the work must also align with business profitability. This shifted my perspective toward identifying where sustainability efforts can generate tangible value for organizations, while still producing meaningful environmental impact.",

VestaESG is what I would have wanted on day one.\n\nBuilt within Realiza, it is a SaaS platform designed for Chilean higher education institutions to measure, report, and manage their environmental impact — aligned with GHG Protocol, Huella Chile, and the sustainability certification requirements of the Chilean higher education system. Because I had spent years inside the problem, I was positioned to define both the product and the data model, not just manage the build.
